Real Estate Exchange Format (REXF) is a listing format that favours convention over configuration.

## Goals
* Simplicity
  * Digestible by people new to real estate.
  * Still informative to brokers and agents alike.
* Conciseness
  * Not too long, but still informative - hence not too short.
* Timeliness
  * Means "the fact or quality of being done or occurring at a favorable or useful time."
  * It must be easy to create, and easy to read.
* Extendable
  * It must support generalized concepts as Literals, ie apartments are apartments.
  * However it must support real estate changes between countries, ie are apartments / flats the same?
